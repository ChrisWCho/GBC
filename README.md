# Recycling Sorting Machine

- This was the Capstone project we developed at George Brown College.
This project was completed during the height of the COVID pandemic in the early-mid 2020, where resources were unobtainable, so the quality of the build was kept at the testing stage in lieu of a polished finish.

This project was to develop a recycling sorting machine while including a robotic arm with 5 degrees of freedom.
With the help of infrared, capacitive, inductive, and photoelectric sensors, our team was able to develop a combination to determine the difference and sort between glass (clear), plastic (clear), metals, and paper objects, specifically cups.
The project also includes stepper motors to control our conveyor to transfer the objects in addition to the servo motors used for the robotic arm, as well as a LCD display for the HMI (Human Machine Interface), and joystick control to allow a user to manually control the robotic arm.
